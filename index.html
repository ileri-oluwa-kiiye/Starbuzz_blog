                    <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
                    <p>
                        <q>A man, a plan, a coffee bean</q>. Okay, that dosen't make a 
                        palindrome, but it resulted in a damn good cup of coffee. Starbuzz's
                        CEO is that man, and you already know his plan: a Starbuzz on every
                        corner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In only a few years he's executed that plan and today you 
                        can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere. And, of course, the 
                        big news this year is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First 
                        readers to create Starbuzz's Web presence, which is growing 
                        rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new 
                        set of customers.
